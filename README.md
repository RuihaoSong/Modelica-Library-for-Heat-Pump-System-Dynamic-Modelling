# Modelica-Library-for-Heat-Pump-System-Dynamic-Modelling

ACADEMIC USE ONLY! 

This is an open-source Modelica library for moving boundary modelling of the heat pump system. Currently, the model is designed for an air source heat pump. A straightforward example is provided for quick testing. All library contents (evaporator, condenser, compressor, and expansion valve models) are stored as one file. You should be able to directly load the .mo file in any Modelica environment, such as OpenModelica or Dymola.

The model is sensitive to some of the parameters and initial conditions. A set of default valves are provided for a quick simulation. If you change some parameters and the model stops working, a possible reason is that the initial conditions you choose are not suitable.

If you are interested in further developing the model or you find any mistake I made in the model, please contact me at: ruihao.song@tum.de

Thank you for reading, and please enjoy!
